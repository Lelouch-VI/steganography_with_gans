# steganography_with_gans
An implementation of Steganography using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) using the Mish activation function as well as a dense and residual critic

This project is still a work in progress.

Future goals 9/2024:
- Clean up code for efficiency and aesthetics
- Implement testing and validation on larger datasets, taken as samples from IStego100k
- Implement testing with bigger batch sizes and more epochs
